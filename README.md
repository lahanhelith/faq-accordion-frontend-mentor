## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to change svgs and I also learned how to add and use variable fonts.

### Continued development

The concept of using variable fonts is still quite confusing for me and I plan on learning more about how variable fonts work.
